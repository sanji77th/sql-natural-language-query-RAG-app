# Chat with Your Database using Natural Language

## Problem:
Data analysts and anyone working with databases frequently rely on writing SQL queries, which can be time-consuming and require familiarity with the specific syntax.
For those less comfortable with SQL, the process can be cumbersome, hindering data exploration and analysis.

## Solution:
RAG simplify database interaction by enabling you to chat with your database using natural language. This intuitive approach empowers you to:
-Formulate queries in a conversational manner, similar to how you'd talk to a colleague.
-Simplify data exploration and analysis, saving valuable time and reducing the learning curve for SQL.

## Key Features:
-Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understand the intent behind your conversational queries and translate them into appropriate SQL statements.
-Streamlit Integration: The application utilizes Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with your database through chat-like prompts.
-Database Connectivity: Connects to your MySQL database, allowing you to directly access and manipulate your data.
-Language Model Integration: For more advanced natural language understanding.

## Tech Stack:
-Python (Core programming language)
-Streamlit (Web framework for building the user interface)
-MySQL (Supported database)
-Langchain (Optional: NLP library for advanced language understanding)
-Google Generative AI (Optional: NLP library for even more advanced language processing)

## Installation:
-Clone this repository: git clone [https://github.com/your-username/rag.git](https://github.com/sanji77th/sql-natural-language-query-RAG-app)
-Navigate to the project directory 
-Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 

## Usage:
-Start the application: python app.py.
-Access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:8501 (default Streamlit port)](https://sql-natural-language-query-rag-app.streamlit.app/).

## Further Development:
-Enhance natural language understanding capabilities by incorporating more advanced NLP techniques or leveraging pre-trained models.
-Support additional database platforms beyond MySQL.
-Implement data visualization features for a more interactive analytical experience.
